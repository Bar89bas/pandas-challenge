Scope: 
This report focuses on studying the student’s performance on math and reading score based on the budget allocations of School. 


Methodology:
Total 39,170 students’ performance report is gathered from 15 different schools and overall percentage of pass in math and reading score is calculated. Also, the total budget allocation for each school. 



Findings:
1.	The budget allocations have minimal impact on the student performance as we can see that there is no huge difference in overall passing percentage based on spending budget for each student.  
2.	The size of the school does impact on the overall passing percentage as we can see smaller the size higher the passing percentage. 
3.	The students that are form independent school has higher passing percentage compare to Government school. 
4.	The students perform from different year has no variance in both math and reading score.  
5.	 The amount of budget allocation is directly related with the number of students i.e. higher the students higher the budget. 



Conclusion: 
The student from independent school performance is better than government school as we can see the overall passing percentage of independent school is 76.97% and passing percentage in math and reading score is 89.20% and 86.24 % . However, the overall passing percentage of government school is 70.69% and passing percentage in maths and reading is 84.46 and 83.58%. Hence, it can be concluded that students from independent school performed better than government school. 
The size of the school is directly related with students performance, higher the number of students lesser the overall passing percentage.
